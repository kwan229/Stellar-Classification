Stellar Classification

This project explores the classification of stars based on various features using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to build models that can accurately categorise stars into predefined types using provided attributes.
This project was undertaken in 2022 in the course of my postgraduate studies.

Stellar Classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

star_classification.csv: The star classification dataset. It was downloaded from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17

Analysis and Classification.docx: The report and findings of stellar classification project.

To classify stars based on features such as temperature, luminosity, radius, colour, and spectral type using algorithms such as:

Random forest classification

Decision tree classification

K nearest neighbor classification

Multiple logistics classification

To run this notebook, youâ€™ll need:

python>=3.8

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn
